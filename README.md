## üé® Color Curves

ColorCurves graphically adjusts per-channel color levels of a TOP using a plotted curve, similar to many image and video editing applications. Credit goes to [Vasily](https://derivative.ca/community-post/asset/color-curves) for authoring the original version of this component, to which I built onto.

<img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanroscover/TDComponents/main/img/colorCurvesScreenshot.png" width="50%" />

### Input
Any TOP can be fed into the component's input. Default is the TD Banana.

### Output
The component's output consists of the graded TOP.

### Usage

#### Channels
`Master` (all channels), `Red`, `Green` and `Blue` channels can be edited individually by selecting them from the top tab menu. All settings can be reset for all 4 channel editors by pulsing the `Reset All` button.

#### Adding/Editing Points
Click anywhere in the curve editor (the square with the thin white diagonal line crossing through it) to add a point at that location. Click and drag to move the point into your desired position. If you click and drag on an existing point, that point will be moved.

#### Removing Points
Right click on any point to remove it.

#### Presets
Presets may be added, edited and removed. They are externalized to a textDAT of your choice in JSON. A default setup will be created onCreate(), or you can always set a new one up by pulsing the `Init Presets` button.

#### Preview / Levels (Histogram)
By default a Preview of your TOP is shown. If you toggle the `Preview` button, it will switch to a Levels display of your current channel, which shows the total amount of values (y axis) in your adjusted TOP, drawn from dark to bright values (x-axis).

#### Single / Split Views
By default a single view of the edited image is shown. To compare against the original, toggle the `Single View` button to the `Split View` mode, which draws a vertical bar in the curve editor that slides from left to right. The original TOP image is on the left, and the edited TOP is on the right.

#### Handles and Reset
The circle handles and curve line call additional draw functions via Render TOPs. To reduce compute in your project, these can be hidden via the `Handles` toggle button. 

Finally, the `Reset` button will reset the current channel being edited.

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Optimeister

Optimeister cooks common CHOP outputs only when their data changes. This considerably improves performance of complex networks with many downstream CHOPs following ones that typically always cook. Supported CHOPs include: Delay, Filter, Lag, Logic, Timer, Trigger, Speed, and Slope.

It accepts channel inputs via custom parameters or a single wire in, which can be multi-channel, allows for renaming of outputs, and the full customization of parameters bound to the CHOP operation specified (Delay/Filter/Lag/etc.).

### Parameters

#### General

* `Reinit` - Reinitializes the component, a sort of reset button.
* `Selectively Uncook Operation` - Bypass the main operation node (usually Filter or Lag CHOP) while it is not actively tweening data. Can greatly improve performance in environments with many instances of Optimeister. Note that this may not always function as intended, and should be disabled if any oddities with output data are observed.
* `Version` - Current version of the component, which can be compared with this repo to confirm the latest version.
* `Help` - Opens this webpage in a browser for the very section you're reading right now... help! #meta
* `GitHub` - Opens the main GitHub repo for downloading any updates to Optimeister.

#### Input

* `Use Wired Input` - Used to disable the use of the wired input instead of the Input parameters (Input0, Input1, etc.). Will automatically set itself when a wired input is connected, and vice-versa will disable itself when disconnected.
* `Num Inputs` - The total number of input channels. Can be set manually when Use Wired Input is disabled. Otherwise, it is set to Read Only and automatically updated to the number of input channels detected when wired input is used.
* `Input * Value` - Each input channel as a parameter. Can be referenced with `op('Optimeister').par.Input0`, etc. Set to Read Only when Use Wired Input is enabled to prevent data stream doubling. Supports expression and bind modes that reference external sources. Note that expression and bind modes will be disabled (reset to constant mode) when a wired input is detected.

#### Output

* `Use Input Channel Names` - When enabled all Output Channels will default to the input channel names if using wired inputs. If using custom parameters on the Input page, they will be Input0, Input1, Input2, etc. When disabled, the Output Channel Names parameters will become editable (instead of Read Only) and override the existing output values when changed. If this parameter is toggled, any edits made are retained in Python storage, so any custom channel names are not immediately lost.
* `Output Channel *` - The name of each output channel as a parameter, editable or Read Only depending on whether the Use Input Channel Names parameter is enabled or not.

#### Operation

* `Operation Type` - The type of CHOP that input data runs through; the intermediary of Optimeister. Supported Operators include: Delay, Filter, Lag, Logic, Timer, Trigger, Speed, and Slope. All parameters of the selected Operation Type are automatically added below this parameter and bound to the intermediary CHOP. This allows for easy external adjustments of settings without diving into the Optimeister base component (useful, for example, if Optimeister operates in a clone setup within a project.)
